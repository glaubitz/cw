  =======================
  [1] GENERAL INFORMATION
  =======================


cwio is part of the cw package. It provides an interface to the kernel
driver of cw. If you plan to use the kernel driver please use cwio instead
of making ioctls to the driver directly. While the ioctl-interface of the
driver changes from time to time the cwio API should be stable, so a
recompilation of your software with a new version of cw should be enough if
you use cwio.


  ============================
  [2] SHORT BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
  ============================


Go to the example subdirectory and type 'make'. This will build two example
programs to show the usage of cwio to read and write tracks. You may use
the Makefile as a template. You just need to adapt the CWIO_DIR variable
to the right place in order to get the cwio.o file compiled to your own
project directory.
