cw 0.13-20090511
	* included cwio as interface to the kernel driver for other programs
	* included new FPGA firmware for MK4 cards
	* support for Victor 9000 disks was added (thanks to Jonathan
	  Gevaryahu for supplying raw images)
	* kernel driver: raw values to be written to disk are now subtracted
	  from 0x7f instead of 0x80
	* changed handling of raw images. raw images created with the current
	  version are not compatible with earlier versions of cwtool, but it
	  is still possible to read older raw images with the current cwtool
	* new option: -o
	* support for textual raw images (useful in combination with -o)
	* consolidated naming scheme for disk formats (thanks to Jonathan
	  Gevaryahu)
	* changed configuration for mac_dsdd_800 and mac_dsdd_800_524.
	  these formats are now using an experimental error correction.
	  this may reduce read errors in some situations (thanks to Yves
	  Benabou for supplying raw images)
	* when writing D64 images the disk id used in sector headers is now
	  taken from the BAM of the D64 image (offsets 0x165a2 and 0x165a3
	  in the D64 image)
	* corrected c1541 formats for 300 rpm drives with 40 and 42 tracks
	* drive directives in /etc/cwtoolrc and ~/.cwtoolrc are now also
	  used with cwtool -R and cwtool -W

cw 0.12.3-20080211
	* changed configuration mac_5.25. writing such images should now be
	  possible (thanks to Matt Carpenter for supplying raw images and
	  testing written images with a real Apple IIc)
	* added configuration mac_5.25_300 for Apple IIe 5.25" disks. this
	  format is an interims solution to support drives with 300 rpm.
	  but do not rely on the existence of these formats in future
	  versions, the handling of drives with different rpm's may change
	  again
	* compile time fixes for Linux 2.6.19+

cw 0.12.2-20070324
	* corrected track ranges in configurations for ibm_dsdd and dg_dsdd
	* lowered needed sync_length for various c1541 configurations
	* adjusted Makefile of the driver to fix compilation problems under
	  Linux 2.4

cw 0.12.1-20070319
	* slightly changed configuration for mac_dd_800 and mac_dd_800_524
	* enabled post compensation in all disk configurations. this should
	  improve readability of disks but will also slow down disk reading
	  especially on older computers with CPUs below 1 GHz

cw 0.12-20070304
	* support for Mac800K disks was added (thanks to Steve Ocepek,
	  Oliver Stabel and Stefan A. Haubenthal for supplying raw images;
	  thanks to Oliver Stabel for giving the useful hint to look at the
	  MESS source http://www.mess.org/, especially the file ap_dsk35.c;
	  thanks to Steve Ocepek for testing the images with a real Mac)
	* added configuration mac_dd_800 and mac_dd_800_524 for Mac800
	  disks. while mac_dd_800_524 writes out all 524 bytes of a sector,
	  mac_dd_800 gives back 512 bytes per sector. this format is
	  understood by "Mini vMac" (http://minivmac.sourceforge.net/).
	  usually the additional 12 bytes in mac_dd_800_524 are not used very
	  often
	* the handling of sector interleave changed. because it is currently
	  only used with the newly introduced mac_dd-formats other formats
	  are not affected
	* a small GUI for cwtool is now available in the contrib/ directory
	  (written by David Bentham a.k.a PegXlin DEV). it uses kaptain and
	  is currently able to read and write Amiga and MSDOS disks
	* while searching for drives the motor is now turned on, because some
	  drives will not seek without this (especially 8" drives, thanks
	  to Jay Jaeger for pointing that out)
	* corrected calculation of the initial value for crc16 and removed
	  wrong byte shift of the sector data in the FM format 
	* added configuration ibm_dsdd, dec_rx01_sssd and dg_dsdd. these
	  formats are used on 8" disks (thanks to Jay Jaeger for supplying
	  raw images)
	* changed configuration for msdos_dd_5.25 (thanks to Oliver Stabel
	  for supplying a raw image)

cw 0.11-20060806
	* changed handling of raw images. raw images created with the current
	  version are not compatible with earlier versions of cwtool, but it
	  is still possible to read older raw images with the current cwtool.
	  the -r option is now important with raw images, because multiple
	  instances of the same track may now be saved
	* it is now possible to give more than one source file to -R, if
	  reading from the first source still gives errors, the others are
	  tried in the given order. with this feature you may create raw
	  images of the same disk with different drives and then try to get
	  the most out of them
	* 'make install' should now add static entries for udev, but it was
	  only tested with SuSE 10.0 and 10.1, please consult the README
	* special support for D64 images with optional error information was
	  added
	* added configuration c1541_d64, c1541_40_d64 and c1541_42_d64 for
	  D64 disk images with 35, 40 and 42 tracks
	* support for 5.25" 360K drives was added (thanks to Jarkko Lethi
	  for supplying such a drive). those drives typically operate with
	  300 rpm instead of 360 rpm like the 1.2M drives do
	* added configuration c1541_300, c1541_40_300, c1541_42_300,
	  c1541_d64_300, c1541_40_d64_300, c1541_42_d64_300, c1541_g64_300,
	  c1541_40_g64_300 and c1541_42_g64_300. these formats are an
	  interims solution to support drives with 300 rpm especially with
	  C1541 formats. but do not rely on the existence of these formats
	  in future versions, the handling of drives with different rpm's
	  may change again
	* added configuration mac_5.25 for Apple IIe 5.25" disks (thanks
	  to Stefan A. Haubenthal for supplying a raw image and to David
	  Empson for giving helpful hints about the format)

cw 0.10-20060215
	* added configuration amiga_dd_5.25 for Amiga 5.25" DD (thanks to
	  Oliver Stabel for supplying a raw image)
	* added configuration mac_hd for Mac 3.5" HD disks (same as msdos_hd)
	* added support for G64 disk images, only images with one speed zone
	  per track are supported, please read the man page for more
	* added configuration c1541_g64, c1541_40_g64 and c1541_42_g64 for
	  G64 disk images with 35, 40 and 42 tracks
	* added configuration c1541_42 for 42 track C1541 images
	* changed configuration for c1541 and c1541_40, but this should
	  be only an issue if you want to use raw image files from earlier
	  versions of cwtool, this change was needed to equalize track
	  numbering with G64 formats
	* added more detailed error reporting if bad sectors where found
	  with -R -v
	* fixed endianess issue in the amiga checksum routine (thanks to
	  Stefan A. Haubenthal for pointing that out)

cw 0.09-20060110
	* new option: -s
	* changed configuration for c1541, c1541_40, c1571 and c1571_40.
	  disks written with version 0.08 may cause read errors in
	  original C1541 and C1571 drives, because the heads are thicker
	  and are also influenced by data between the tracks (one track
	  on C1541/C1571 drives are two tracks in 5.25" HD drives). when
	  writing such disks the tracks inbetween are now cleared,
	  furthermore other timings are used
	* corrected track numbering for c1571, but i do not own a C1571 so
	  i could not test if it is now working correctly

cw 0.08-20051202
	* first official release
