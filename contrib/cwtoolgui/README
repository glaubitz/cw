# This is a quick GUI for cwtool to Read/Write amiga adf files back/forth to
# floppy quickly using the Catweasl MK4 PCI card

Tested on ubuntu dapper 6.06 all versions.

You must have kaptain installed to use this script/s.
(sudo apt-get install kaptain)

# How to install these scripts

1. Copy cwtoolreadgui and cwtoolwritegui to /bin folder and change
   permissions to executable (chmod 755 /bin/cwtoolgui)

2. Copy the root-cwtoolreadgui, root-cwtoolwritegui to
   /home/*userhome*/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts (Automatix can install
   nautilus-scripts), again change the file permissions to executable (see
   above).

Thats it!

Enjoy!
